Michael Adams Programming
August 15, 2001


What's New?

     This is maintenance encouraged by some anonymous updates from people
     who are still actively engaged in L2 gameplay: as for myself, my BBS
     has been offline since March of 1999, and my programming has been
     lacking. :( I encourage anyone who is interested to take up my work
     and make this the game it should be (or port it to another platorm).


Introduction

     This is a full version of the "TEOS LORD" project: a LORD2 world based
     on Seth Able Robinson's "Planets:TEOS" software.


Features

     1. 350+ Graphical Maps, interchanging between surface/ship/space terrains.
     2. 3 Parties: Alliance, Maraken, Snaken.
     3. The original 26 planets, plus 4 "Snaken" worlds.
     4. The original 16 ships, plus 3 "Snaken" vessels.
        (Each ship has proper weapon, armour, HP, react., torp. & hold limits)
     5. Most of the original trade goods from "Planets."
        (Slugs added; 17 goods in all)
     6. A LORD2-style quest system.
        (6 locations, 5 goods)
     7. 7 weapons & 7 armours.
        (To replace fighters & provide defense ability)
     8. Use of HP's as shields.
     9. Reactors, torpedoes, & ships holds.
     10. The Schooloria Library, Dremora Temple, & Galactic Banks.
     11. Most of the original ANSI's, plus some new ones.
     12. New World style Bounty Hunting & Casino.


Installation

     1. You've already unzipped this program (assumed). Be sure you used
        "PKUNZIP -D", & not "PKUNZIP".
     2. Use L2CFG to plug in the proper settings & reg. codes.
     3. Edit RULES.REF to change in-game settings.
     4. Modify LORD2.BAT to accomodate your system.
     5. Modify your BBS to accomodate TEOS LORD.


Resetting

     1. Go to the game directory.
     2. Use RESET.BAT. Follow its instructions!

     addons. You can find it at one of my websites listed at the end of this

In the future...

     *. My development of this game is probably complete. It will be you, the
        developer, to continue my work as proposed below...

     1. The Ja'dra Realm: The massive new area in the game; currently unused.
                          This will be very calculatory in nature, and will
                          combine the forces of the other galactic nations.

     2. The Great Flight: The end of the game. Ja'dra technology will permit
                          the allied nations to produce a warp-ship, designed
                          to cross extra-galactic space.
